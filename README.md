📚 Generative AI Learning Notes – Rohit Negi

1️⃣ Introduction to Generative AI(GEN AI)

=> Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that creates new data/content such as text, images, music, or code based on learned patterns from training data.

2️⃣ Core Concepts

Tokenization
=> Breaking down input text into smaller chunks (tokens) for model processing. They are analyzing the pattern of giving input, and they convert 
or, behind the scenes, they make assumptions like the number of giving sentences.
=> Models work on token sequences instead of raw text.

Behind the scenes:

Uses Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) or SentencePiece.

Each token is mapped to an ID in a vocabulary.

GPT => Generative Pre-Trained Transform
